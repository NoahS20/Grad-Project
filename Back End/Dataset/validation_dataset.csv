Please describe your favorite sport or activity.,"My favorite sport involves with two teams of five people who have baskets at each end of a wooden floor, and each team takes turn dribbling an orange leather ball down the wooden floor and try to throw the ball into the basket; while the other team is trying their best to not let the team with the ball get the ball into the basket, but get it into their basket.",User

Please describe your favorite sport or activity.,"My favorite sport is volleyball, a sport where people interact with each other through a ball. This ball is inflatable and is softer than a basketball, allowing players of the sport to easily hit it without injuring themselves. Players can pass, set and spike this ball. Passing invovles the making of a solid platform by holding both arms together, one hand encasing the other. The platform stays steady while the player uses their legs and torso to send the ball where they want it to go. Setting involes the usage of the players' hands and legs. The players hands form a triangular or diamond shaped basket with all fingers spread as far as possible. They keep this steady around the ball while using their arms and legs to push the ball where they want it to go. Spiking involves the player making an approach to the net where the ball is expected to fall, hitting it to the other side at their highest point of contact with it, before it can hit the ground on their team's side. There are numerous ways to approach and it is unique to the player. Teams can also block their opponent's spikes by standing close to the net, jumping with both arms up, and pressing them forward to block the balls path. Players can pass the ball by receiving it from a spike or from a spike that is bouncing off of a block. Players can also tip the ball over instead of spiking which can be a strategy to throw off opponents. The game is played with 6 people on each side of the net. If the players are on a scoring streak, they stay in the same spot. If they lose their streak, and gain a point, they rotate one spot on the court clockwise. Within these rotations, players can stand at different spots on the court according to the teams strategy. The placement of these players at the start of the match is also a vital part of the team's strategy. High school has different policys, but games are generally best 2 out of 3 or 3 out of 5, meaning the first to 2 or 3 wins the match. in the event that both teams have 2 wins, they play a 5th round to 15 points instead of 25. In addition to the 6 key players, teams may want to have as many as 10 additional players ready on the sidelines to be switched in for one of the 6 on the court at any time. These substitutions can be stragetic or for emergencies. Volleyball has a few position titles: Setter, Defensive Specialist (D/S), Hitter (Outside/Opposite, Right Side, Middle), and Libero. In the case of a libero, they are not allowed to play in the front row of the court if they've been officially designated as one. As such, a middle hitter/blocker is set opposite of the libero on the court, so that when they are about to rotate to the back row, the libero can switch with them to be on the court without using a substitution. When the libero is about to go to the front row, they will switch again with the middle withohut using a substitution. All other players have to use substitutions to move on and of the court which is why the usage of substitutions and positions has to be carefully planned. There are only about 20 substitutions in one set (note: a set is what the mini matches within the game are called.) Some teams may also have a designated server they use to disturb the opponents rhythm causing them to make mistakes. However, this person may also not be a regular player that sees a lot of play time, either due to lack of skill in other areas, or due to better options. They can be subbed in to do this server. Some call this a ""pinch server.""",User
